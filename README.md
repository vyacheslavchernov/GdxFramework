# GDX Framework 

Self-written libGDX add-on for developing simple (yet) games. Yes, the project replicates many of the features of libGDX itself, but who doesn't like to reinvent the wheel in their spare time?


A wiki for the project is **in progress**.

Project documentation **in progress**.


In the future, I would like to try to add the whole GUI for this, 
so that everything is in the manner of a real game engine like GameMaker.
